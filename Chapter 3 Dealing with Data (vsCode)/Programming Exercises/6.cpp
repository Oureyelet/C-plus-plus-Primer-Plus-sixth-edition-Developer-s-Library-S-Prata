/**
    Chapter 3 -- Programming Exercises:

    6)  Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many gallons
        of gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your car has gotten.
        Or, if you prefer, the program can request distance in kilometers and petrol in liters
        and then report the result European style, in liters per 100 kilometers.
